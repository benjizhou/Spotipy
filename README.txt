R	Next Ideas

Use a database (MongoDB)

Get top songs and then make a playlist out of them
then take that playlist and create a similar playlist
then delete first playlist

Take a song and get recommended artists and then take top 5 songs
from all of the recommended to make a new playlist

Get song radio songs and then get out all music identifiers,
use R k-means to find out how related they are
